The file 'final_merged.txt' contains 180 rows and 81 columns. The rows correspond to the records for each of the 6 activities
performed by each of the 30 subjects with means of all the variables for each activity and subject combination. For example,
the first row with activity WALKING and subject 1 denotes the means of all the means and standard deviation variables.

The variable names in columns 3 to 81 are unchanged from the feature names to prevent confusion. So in the first row, 
the column 'tBodyAcc-mean()-X' denotes the mean of all the measured 'tBodyAcc-mean()-X' values for the given activity and subject
combination.
